# Pirate Weather

Weather for Gladys from [Pirate Weather](https://pirateweather.net/), the open
successor of the Dark Sky API: current conditions, 24-hour and 8-day forecasts,
the next 60 minutes of rain and snow minute by minute, and official weather
alerts — tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, hurricane, heat, winter
storm warnings from the National Weather Service in the United States, and the
alerts of Environment Canada and of the European weather services.

It works anywhere in the world with a **free API key**.

**Powered by Pirate Weather.** This integration is a community project, not
affiliated with Pirate Weather.

## What you get

- **The Gladys weather widget and the chat assistant** use Pirate Weather:
  current conditions, the next 24 hours, the next 8 days, sunrise and sunset,
  UV index, and the active alerts with their full text. Everything is shown in
  **°F and mph** or **°C and m/s**, following the unit system of each Gladys
  user.
- **Weather alert scenes**: the built-in Gladys trigger "Weather alert" works
  with the Pirate Weather alerts — for example "when a tornado warning is
  issued for my house, turn every light on and send me a message". The
  integration tells Gladys as soon as an alert appears or changes, so the
  scene starts within a minute of the refresh that saw it.
- **Scene trigger "Rain or snow expected within the hour"**: fires when the
  minute-by-minute forecast starts showing precipitation within the hour.
- **Scene action "Get the precipitation of the next hour"**: tells a scene
  whether rain or snow is coming, when, and how strong — to close the awning
  or skip the sprinklers.
- **Dashboard widget "Precipitation, next hour"**: the minute-by-minute chart
  of the next 60 minutes.

## Before you start: get your free API key

1. Go to [pirateweather.net](https://pirateweather.net/) and click **Sign up**.
2. Once signed in, **subscribe to the forecast API** with the free plan
   (10,000 calls a month). Without this step the key is refused.
3. Copy your **API key**.

A new key can take **up to 20 minutes** before it works: if the test below
fails right after signing up, wait a little and try again.

## Installation

1. In Gladys, check that your house has a location: **Settings → Houses**,
   then set the address or the position on the map. The integration refreshes
   the weather of every house that has one.
2. Install **Pirate Weather** from the integration catalog. Gladys asks you to
   allow access to the location of your houses: it is needed to fetch their
   weather.
3. Open the **Configuration** tab, paste your API key, and save.
4. Click **Test the API key**. The answer shows the current temperature at
   your house and the calls left this month.

That's it: the weather widget of your dashboard now shows Pirate Weather. If
another weather integration is installed, you can choose the provider in the
settings of the weather widget.

## Configuration

- **Pirate Weather API key** — your key. It is only ever sent to Pirate
  Weather, and never written in the logs.
- **Refresh interval** — leave **Automatic** unless you have a reason (see
  below). The manual choices go from every 15 minutes to every 2 hours.
- **Language of the scene texts** — the language of the sentences the
  integration writes in scene variables ("Heavy rain expected in 12 minutes
  (90% chance)."). **Automatic** follows the language of your Gladys.

## How often the weather is refreshed, and your quota

Every refresh costs **one call per house**, and that single call feeds
everything: the dashboard, the chat, the alerts, the scenes and the widget.
Opening the dashboard costs nothing: Gladys is served from the forecast in
memory.

In **Automatic** mode, the integration keeps its refreshes under **half of your
monthly quota**, and never refreshes more often than every 15 minutes (the
interval Pirate Weather recommends):

| Houses with a location | Free plan (10,000 calls) | $2/month plan (20,000 calls) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1                      | every 15 min — 2,976/mo  | every 15 min — 2,976/mo      |
| 2                      | every 20 min — 4,464/mo  | every 15 min — 5,952/mo      |
| 3                      | every 30 min — 4,464/mo  | every 15 min — 8,928/mo      |
| 4                      | every 45 min — 3,968/mo  | every 20 min — 8,928/mo      |

The other half is a safety margin: restarts, a house added during the month,
the test button, and any other use of the same key.

Every answer of Pirate Weather tells how many calls are left until the monthly
reset, and the integration watches it: if the calls left cannot carry the
current pace until the reset (because the key is shared with another
application, for instance), the interval is stretched to fit. A manual
interval obeys the same rule. When only a handful of calls remain, the
refreshes pause until the reset: Gladys keeps showing the last forecast for up
to 3 hours, then falls back to its other weather provider if it has one.

[Pirate Weather usage page](https://docs.pirateweather.net/en/latest/CheckUsage/).

## Scenes

### Weather alerts (built into Gladys)

In a scene, pick the trigger **Weather alert**, choose the house, a phenomenon
(any, wind, thunderstorm, flood, heat, cold, snow...) and a minimum severity.
Pirate Weather alerts are classified for it:

- **Severity**: the official one — _Extreme_ for a tornado warning, _Severe_
  for most warnings, _Moderate_ for watches and many advisories, _Minor_ for
  statements.
- **Phenomenon**: read from the alert title. Tornado and severe thunderstorm
  alerts are _thunderstorm_; hurricane and tropical storm alerts are _wind_;
  storm surge, high surf and rip current alerts are _coastal_; winter storm,
  blizzard, ice storm and freezing rain alerts are _snow_; wind chill, freeze
  and frost alerts are _cold_. Alerts with no matching phenomenon (red flag
  warning, air quality alert, special weather statement) still reach the "any
  phenomenon" scenes.

Example: _Weather alert, house Home, phenomenon thunderstorm, severity extreme_
→ turn on all the lights and send a message to the family.

### Rain or snow expected within the hour

Fires once when the minute-by-minute forecast shows precipitation within the
hour where the previous refresh showed none. Filters: the house (its name,
exactly as in Gladys; empty for any house), the kind of precipitation (rain,
snow, sleet, freezing rain) and the strongest intensity expected (light,
moderate, heavy).

Variables for the following actions: the house, the precipitation, the
intensity, the minutes until it starts, the probability, and a ready-made
sentence — for example "Heavy rain expected in 18 minutes (90% chance)."

A minute counts as wet from 0.1 mm/h (0.004 in/h) with a probability of at
least 40%. Light is under 0.1 in/h (2.5 mm/h), heavy above 0.3 in/h
(7.6 mm/h). The trigger does not fire twice for the same house within 45
minutes, and never on the first refresh after a restart.

### Get the precipitation of the next hour

A scene action that reads the minute-by-minute forecast of a house (empty: your
first house) and returns whether precipitation is expected, in how many
minutes, its kind, intensity and probability, and a sentence. Use a condition
on _Precipitation expected_ to decide what comes next. It costs no call.

## Dashboard

- The **Weather** widget of Gladys shows Pirate Weather as soon as the
  integration is configured.
- The **Precipitation, next hour** widget, added to a dashboard like any
  widget, draws the next 60 minutes in in/h or mm/h. Leave the "House"
  setting empty for your first house, or type the name of another one.

## Limits

- **Minute-by-minute is model data, not radar.** Over the United States it
  comes from the HRRR sub-hourly model; elsewhere from coarser global models.
  It is refreshed at the pace of your quota, every 15 minutes at best: a
  shower that pops up between two refreshes is announced by the next one.
- **Alerts depend on the region.** The United States (National Weather
  Service), Canada and Europe are well covered; elsewhere it depends on what
  the national service publishes to the WMO. Outside the United States, alert
  titles are in the language of the national service (French in Québec, German
  in Germany).
- **No minute-by-minute forecast** for a location: the trigger stays silent,
  the action and the widget say so.
- **Houses are matched by name** in the scene and widget fields: type the name
  exactly as shown in Gladys.
- The integration needs Gladys 5.1 or later.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Pirate Weather refused the API key"** — check the key, and that you
  subscribed to the forecast API in your Pirate Weather account. A new key can
  take 20 minutes to work. Then click **Test the API key**: if it works, the
  refreshes start again on their own.
- **"Monthly Pirate Weather quota spent"** — the refreshes resume after the
  monthly reset (the date is shown). Reduce the number of houses or set a
  longer interval, or support Pirate Weather to double your quota.
- **"No house of Gladys has a location"** — set the location of your house in
  **Settings → Houses**.
- **The dashboard still shows another provider** — open the settings of the
  weather widget and choose Pirate Weather.
- **Logs**: the **Logs** tab of the integration shows each refresh and the
  interval chosen ("next refresh in 15 min (auto)").

## Privacy

The coordinates of your houses and your API key are sent to Pirate Weather to
get the forecast, and nowhere else. Nothing is stored on disk.
